Larger World
============

A Bukkit plugin representing my "first steps into a larger world."

When I began this project, there were three things about my programming knowledge that I wanted to change:

- I was a Bukkit noob.
- I was a Git/Github noob.
- I was a Maven noob.

So, I decided that I would begin an exceedingly simple software project that would allow me to develop a baseline of knowledge in each of these three areas. Specifically, I would create a simple Bukkit plugin, build it with Maven, and host it on Github.

Much of this plugin was based upon the [plugin tutorial](http://wiki.bukkit.org/Plugin_Tutorial) on the Bukkit Wiki.
